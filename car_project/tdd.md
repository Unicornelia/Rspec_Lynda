## TDD

Test Driven Development
- Very small test, write code to pass, another small test
- Clean up code with passing tests

1. Write test
2. Run the test => red
3. Write minimum code
4. Run test
5. Clean up code

* Red, green, refactor
* Writing failing test, code to get test to pass, clean up

**YAGNI ("You aren't going to need it") - let the test drive you, dont over write your code**

* Rspec was created for TDD
* TDD has many proponents and opponents
